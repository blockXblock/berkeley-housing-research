the work is to harvest, normalize, and join them into a parcel‑centric knowledge graph keyed by APN and address.[1][2][3]\nOverall ingestion and data model\n\nAnchor everything on a master parcels table (one row per parcel) with APN, address, zoning district, land use, building footprint, and geometry; this comes from the Berkeley Open Data parcel layer and Community GIS.[2][3]\nFor the digital twin, design a schema where each parcel links to: permits (building, zoning, fire), ZAB actions, use permits, inspections, plans, staff reports, and any external datasets (assessor data, census, UC housing inventories).[4]\n\nCore city systems and document sources\n\nZoning Adjustments Board (ZAB): Agendas, packets, minutes, and supplemental communications are published for each meeting and link to project‑level staff reports and plans; the board’s page is the entry point for bulk scraping of ZAB PDFs and metadata.[5][6]\nUse permits: The Use Permit page describes required applications and points to the zoning permit application process; actual records and attachments live in Permits Online / Accela (module “Zoning”) and in Building Eye as map‑linked items.[7][8][1]\nBuilding and other permits: BuildingEye and the Accela Citizen Portal / Permits Online expose searchable records and attached plans (PDF) for building, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and fire permits since roughly the mid‑1990s.[8][9][4]\n\nOpen datasets, GIS, and base maps\n\nOpen Data Portal: Hosts tabular and GIS datasets for parcels, zoning, land use, business licenses, some transportation and environmental layers, all downloadable as CSV, shapefile, or GeoJSON for ingestion into your database or geospatial stack.[10][2]\nCommunity GIS Portal: Web map front‑end with layers for parcels, zoning, environmental constraints, transportation, and city facilities; some of these layers correspond to downloadable open‑data sets and provide authoritative geometries for the digital twin.[3]\nZoning dataset and official zoning map: The “Zoning” GIS layer defines all zoning districts and is the authoritative source for zone boundaries; the Berkeley Municipal Code’s Official Zoning Map provides legal zoning designations for cross‑checking.[11][12]\n\nPermits, plans, and structural information\n\nPermits Online / Accela attachments: For each building or zoning permit record, attachments include architectural plans, structural calculations, energy compliance documentation, and inspection reports; these PDFs are accessible through Record Info → Attachments.[9][8]\nBuildingEye: Provides an interactive map of planning and building permits; use it to discover records by location and to cross‑walk address, permit IDs, and parcel/APN before ingesting details from Accela.[1][4]\nHistoric and non‑digitized records: The city notes that some older permits and plans are not fully online and must be retrieved via in‑person records research or public records requests; these would need scanning and manual indexing to complete the digital twin.[13][4]\n\nZAB, use permit, and staff report corpus\n\nZAB meeting packets and supplemental communications: Each meeting packet aggregates staff reports, project plans, draft findings, conditions of approval, and public correspondence; these packets form a rich text corpus for project‑level decisions and design evolution.[6][5]\nStaff guidance and application requirements: The Use Permit and Zoning Permits pages link to submittal requirement documents and guides that specify what drawings and reports applicants must provide, giving a template for what to expect in each project file.[14][7]\nResearch Zoning Permits page: The “Research zoning permits and zone designations” page explains how to use BuildingEye and the three main databases (BuildingEye, Permits Online, and Community GIS) to locate permit and zoning information for any building or parcel.[1]\n\nExternal and academic data sources\n\nState and regional GIS repositories: The California Open Data portal and state GIS hubs host additional Berkeley datasets (e.g., statewide city boundaries, environmental layers) that can be layered onto the digital twin.[15][16]\nUC Berkeley Library GIS holdings: The Earth Sciences &amp; Map Library maintains parcel snapshots and other Bay Area GIS datasets that can enrich or validate city data, accessible at dedicated GIS workstations.[16]\nReal estate and assessor data: Public assessor sites and commercial platforms provide assessed values, building year, and sometimes unit counts keyed by APN, useful for augmenting the parcel‑level schema you already envisioned.\n\nPractical ingestion and integration steps\n\nUse scripted crawlers to harvest ZAB agendas/packets, parse project tables inside each PDF to extract application numbers, addresses, and actions, then join those to permit IDs from Accela / BuildingEye and to APNs from the parcel dataset.[6][1]\nPull periodic exports (or API pulls where possible) from BuildingEye and Accela to build time‑series tables of permits, inspections, and statuses; standardize on APN and normalized address as join keys across all systems.[4][8]\nImport GIS layers (parcels, zoning, land use) into a spatial database (PostGIS or SpatiaLite) and perform spatial joins so every permit, ZAB action, and document is attached to both a parcel polygon and its zoning district; this becomes the spatial backbone of the digital twin.[3][11]\n\nThis plan yields a parcel‑centric corpus where each structure and parcel in Berkeley is linked to its full regulatory, design, and permit history, ready for visualization and simulation in a Berkeley digital twin.[2][1]\nSources\n[1] Research Zoning Permits and Zone Designations | City of Berkeley berkeleyca.gov/construction-development/land-use-development/research-zoning-permits-and-zone-designations\n[2] Open Data Portal - The City of Berkeley berkeleyca.gov/your-government/public-records/open-data-portal\n[3] Community GIS Portal berkeleyca.gov/city-services/community-gis-portal\n[4] Can I combine data from Alameda County parcel records, the city of Berkeley parcel records, and other open source housing records for Berkeley to establish how many housing units are on each parcel www.perplexity.ai/search/5ffd159f-f4ed-40aa-a2b0-6f1d7a497fec\n[5] Research Permit Records | City of Berkeley berkeleyca.gov/construction-development/permits-design-parameters/permit-process/research-permit-records\n[6] Zoning Adjustments Board - The City of Berkeley berkeleyca.gov/your-government/boards-commissions/zoning-adjustments-board\n[7] [PDF] ZONING ADJUSTMENTS BOARD - The City of Berkeley berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/legislative-body-meeting-agendas/2025-12-11_ZAB_Agenda_Linked.pdf\n[8] Use Permit | City of Berkeley berkeleyca.gov/construction-development/permits-design-parameters/permit-types/use-permit\n[9] Building Permits - City of Berkeley aca-prod.accela.com/BERKELEY/Cap/CapHome.aspx\n[10] Permits Online | City of Berkeley berkeleyca.gov/construction-development/permits-design-parameters/permit-process/permits-online\n[11] City of Berkeley Open Data - The City of Berkeley data.cityofberkeley.info\n[12] Zoning | Open Data | City of Berkeley data.cityofberkeley.info/dataset/Zoning/iknk-w4qw\n[13] Official Zoning Map - Berkeley Municipal Code berkeley.municipal.codes/BMC/OfficialZoningMap\n[14] Berkeley Permit History Information - Megan Micco - Megan Micco www.meganmicco.com/blog/berkeley-permit-history/\n[15] Zoning Permits | City of Berkeley berkeleyca.gov/construction-development/permits-design-parameters/permit-types/zoning-permits\n[16] City of Berkeley - Dataset - California Open Data - CA.gov data.ca.gov/dataset/city-of-berkeley\n[17] California &amp;
